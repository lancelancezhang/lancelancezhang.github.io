excerpt: "Creating the Fizzbuzz Game"

Since phones have been such an integral part of our lives and technology in general,
I took some steps into experimenting and learning about how Android Studio worked
and understanding how the user interacts with a mobile interface.

The app that I created was a game based off of the beginner's programming
task FizzBuzz.

Opening Screen shown here:

It plays like normal Fizzbuzz, except you have a score at the very top of the screen.
The score falls to zero if you don't press the correct button.

Specifically there wasn't anything challenging in this creating this, but instead
it was really interesting learning about how user interfaces were created on
this platform.
