This short but sweet project was quick look into how user interfaces worked with
mobile phones. I used Android Studios to implement the code for a FizzBuzz game, based
off of the beginner programming task.

Opening Screen shown here:

It plays like FizzBuzz, where you have to click the number to increment upwards, and
press Fizz for multiples of 3, Buzz for multiples of 5 and FizzBuzz for multiples of 15.
There is a score at the very top of the screen that falls to zero if the incorrect
button is pressed.

The only challenged that I faced building this project was figuring out how the anchoring
of specific components on the screen worked. The UI builder worked this way because
different screen sizes have to be accounted for when building apps, and it's not something
I typically thought about before taking on this project.
