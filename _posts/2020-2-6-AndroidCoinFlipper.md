excerpt: "Exploring Android Studio - Creating a Coin Flipper"

I've had an interest in android application development, as it is interesting
to me to see how code can directly translate into something that the end user
interacts with. I looked into Android Studio and explored it by creating a
simple coin flipper and exporting it as an .apk file to run on my phone.
