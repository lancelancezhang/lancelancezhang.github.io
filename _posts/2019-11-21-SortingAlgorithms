excerpt: "Examining different sorting algorithms using python"
---

Sorting algorithms are a very core principle to understand. It fascinates me that there are different methods of doing the same operations and that finding ones that are more efficient are consequently more useful.

I simulated many different sorting algorithms using python and timed them.

This is a table of summaries for the times of the different sorting algorithms
