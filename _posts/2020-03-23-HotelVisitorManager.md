excerpt: "Learning how to do object oriented programming"

In my Object Oriented Programming class in university I was learning the key
concepts behind Java and OOP. In this class assignment I had to complete an
implementation of a Hotel Visitor Manager.

Specifically in this assignment I was learning the basics behind abstraction
and encapsulation with the use and creation of appropriate classes, objects and
methods that fit with what the client wanted.

Some example of some code can be seen below:



I faced a lot of problems understanding how objects were able to 'communicate'
with one another at first and did a lot of troubleshooting centred around
public/private and instance/static methods and fields. Once it clicked, however,
it was not too much work to finish off the assignment.


For more about how the assignment worked, I have the download file in my
GitHub.
