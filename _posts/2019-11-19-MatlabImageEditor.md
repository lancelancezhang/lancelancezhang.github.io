## Project Outline

This action shot and remove action was my project as part of my first year engineering programming paper ENGGEN 131.

An example of its functions can be seen in the images below with the following set of 4 images:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/matlab/Overview.JPG" alt="">


Action Shot

The action shot function that I wrote combines each of the images in the set to create an 'action shot':

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/matlab/Action Shot.JPG" alt="">


Remove Action

The image remover script on the other hand does the opposite - it uses the three images in order to remove objects from the images to create 'remove action' image:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/matlab/Remove Action.JPG" alt="">

Another example of the action shot and the remove action being applied is also seen in the example below:
