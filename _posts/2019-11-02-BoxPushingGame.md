# Box Pushing Game

This Command line Box Pushing Game was my final project for a C programming paper that
I took at university.

The project centered around a Box Pushing Game, where the user controls a player
on the screen to attempt to push a box into a specific target. This command line
takes input from the player as movement and the position of the player is updated through various
lines of different print statements.

This can be seen below:

The most difficult aspect of this project was implementing the different interactions
that the player had with different objects on the map. This included immovable walls,
a movable box, that would not be movable when pushed against a wall, and many more.

However, once implementing all the features to this game, it was highly rewarding.
